	  "description" : "So I usually have a bunch of expeditions in my games. Usually I have a station or two around Kerbin, stations around and bases on the Mun and Minmus, and a few scattered throughout the rest of the Kerbol system. This is just the beginning... As I need more, I'll add more. Also, I've come up with a way to indicate the Commander and 2IC for each program by adding either a Gold star or a Silver star to the ribbon. ",
