    "description": "Kerbal Life Science is a collection of multi-step experiments inspired by real-world ISS science experiments. To run experiments, you have to launch laboratories, equipment, and the experiments themselves and perform some assembly in-orbit before the experiments can be run. The idea is to run the experiments in the background while you do other missions.",
