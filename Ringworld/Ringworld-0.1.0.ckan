    "description": "200 light years from Earth, a huge ring revolves around its lonely star. The inner surface hosts a biosphere millions of times the area of Earth's, but otherwise similar in its distance to its sun, spin gravity, and even its day-night cycle, thanks to enormous 'shadow squares' selectively blocking the sun. Now you can observe this incredible artifact from your favorite Kerbal vessel!",
