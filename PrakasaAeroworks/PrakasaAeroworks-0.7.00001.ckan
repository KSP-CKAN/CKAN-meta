    "abstract": "Freshly imported from an interstellar race with no Prime Directive, Prakasa is a pod and engine focused pack aimed at aircraft and spaceplanes, namely with the objective of filling the 2.5 meter void between the diminutive Mk2 and massive Mk3. 13 cockpits total as of 0.7, all featuring RPM IVAs. The parts are themed towards a somewhat more distant future than stock, offering greater interior space and a cleaner, spaceship-er aesthetic.",
