    "abstract": "I think that a lot of us agree that its the little details in games that make the biggest difference. With that in mind myself and Rob Forrest have set out to make a mod pack with all the little things that you dont see in the game. While this pack is mostly oriented towards an RP that we a part of and as such will feature mostly military related items, we will take requests for non military things as well and will respond to as many as possible. So let us know what you think so far and what you think should be included in the future. Thanks for your support and enjoy!",
